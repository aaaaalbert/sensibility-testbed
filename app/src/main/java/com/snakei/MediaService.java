/**
 * Created by lukas.puehringer@nyu.edu
 * on 5/27/16.
 *
 * A pseudo Service class that facades Android media services
 *
 * Provides methods to start and stop Text-To-Speech engine,
 * synthesize text to speech, record from the default microphone
 * and get information about whether media is being played on the
 * device or if text is synthesized to speech
 *
 * This class is a Singleton using the thread safe
 * Java Initialization on Demand Holder pattern
 * (cf. SensorService.java for more info )
 *
 * Todo:
 *   - Currently we use default settings for text to speech and  audio
 *     recording Should we allow the user to change these settings?
 *
 *   - Same story as in other Sensibility Services, how do we handle
 *     initialization and release of resources?
 *
 *   - Doesn't implement get_media_play_info() from old API anymore,
 *     could be added

     * Notes:
     * This strategy is preferred over non-blocking, because Android
     * makes it hard to determine the current state of a MediaRecorder
     * which in turn makes proper resource handling (release when finished)
     * difficult.
     *
     * Possible non-blocking approach
     *      For a non blocking approach we could use recording session duration:
     *      recorder.setMaxDuration(int max_duration_ms) or a custom timer
     *      together with info or error listener:
     *          recorder.setOnInfoListener(OnInfoListener) or
     *          recorder.setOnErrorListener(OnErrorListener)
     *
     * There are a lot of things that can be parametrized
     *     e.g. Format, Encoder, ...
